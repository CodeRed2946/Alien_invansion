Alien Invasion is an arcade game where the user has to use a ship to destroy all the aliens in the screen to reach the next level. As the levels increase, the aliens and the ship's bullets both move faster, the user has to steer the ship dexterously to create a new high score. The game ends when either the aliens collide with the ship or they reach the bottom of the screen.
